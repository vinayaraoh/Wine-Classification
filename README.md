# Wine-Classification

Italy and France are historically among the countries that produce the most prestigious wines worldwide. This dataset characterizes the Protected Designation of Origin(PDO) label wines produced in Italy and France at very high detail based on the official EU documents. In this project, I build a logistic regression model to predict the country of wine origin (IT/FR) based on features of the wine like colour, type and maximum allowed yields.
